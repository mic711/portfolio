        <p>My name is Michel Enad, a Senior at Dublin High School. My ambition in life is to be a Software Engineer. My plan to become a Software Engineer is first, to complete the Engineering Academy program in my high school. In addition, I plan on getting involved in the community, which will help me pursue my career. This will give me a better understanding on how to help others and work with other people. To add on, I want to find a job or internship before I enter college. Then after High School, I plan to go to a four year college and get a degree in computer or software engineering. During college, I would also like to build my connections to the software engineering field by either finding a job or internship related to software engineering.I can be a Software Engineer because my skill set and experience matches what an Software Engineer does on a regular basis. For example, on a daily basis, a Software Engineer works with specific programming software in order to generate a computer program or software. I have experience with multiple types of programming software, like Python, Net logo, and Robotc. To add on, a high percentage of software engineers work in a team to develop a computer program or software. I have been part of multiple basketball teams and clubs, like the Dublin High Freshman Basketball team and California Scholarship Federalization. Being apart of these teams and clubs have helped me to learn the skill of teamwork, and that is a skill used everyday in a software engineer's life. In addition, I learned the basic skills of computer programming in the High School Course, Principles of Engineering. In Principles of Engineering, we explore the different engineering disciplines and careers. Because of this course, I have a well rounded background in all engineering disciplines just in case I change my pathway to a different type of engineering career.I learned that I have to get more involved in community. I believe that people should give back to the community because the community has done so much us. A community should work together to make the environment more peaceful. If everyone starts volunteering at soup kitchens, or donating clothes to the community, I believe that the community will be a better place. Being involved in the community will help me become a better person and help me understand the problems in the community so that I can help solve those problems. Because there are many types of people who volunteer, and volunteering could help me build connections to companies or business.</p>
