<strong>Course:</strong> Intro to Engineering Design
</br>
<strong>Duration:</strong> Feb-March 2016
</br>
<strong>Objective:</strong> Model and design virtual toy trains
</br>
<strong>Team Members:</strong> Justin Lee and Wesley Wong 
 </br>
For this project, my team and I were asked to model and design toy trains on Inventor for kids to play with. Inventor is a program where you can design 3-D models of objects. The train cars had to be able to connect together and have a common theme. In addition, train cars had to be colorful and match the theme to interest kids from age 5 to 11. This project started in February of 2016, and ended in March of 2016. I was responsible for making a car train that looks like the Ferry Building because my team's theme was San Francisco. The Ferry Building car was the second highest vote for favorites. The voters were 5th graders for Murray Elementary school. My car was interesting and intriguing to the kids because it had beds, was well-built, exotic colors, and looked really similar to the real thing.Moreover, I was in charge of updating the gantt chart and making the gantt for my team. A gantt chart helps keep my team and I on task and on schedule. It gives the dates when things are due, and when they are done. I updated by the gantt chart by writing and highlighting things that represented completion and who had to do it. Another task I completed was make technical drawings on Inventor for the Ferry Building. This was important because the requirements for technical drawings was 6 interesting parts, and my car had many interesting parts my team and I could use. The interesting parts on my Ferry building that we used were the letters that spelled out Port of San Francisco, the roof of the car, and the engine bod of the train. In addition, I helped make a presentation that highlighted my train and my group's train for my fellow classmates and 5th graders. In conclusion, this project helped me learn how to make more objects look more realistic and how to present something to younger kids who do not know the project.

<strong>Course:</strong> Principles of Engineering 
</br>
<strong>Duration:</strong> May 8 to May 22 2017
</br>
<strong>Objective:</strong> Construct an invention or make a software that helps solve an individual need or world problem. 
</br>
<strong>Team Members:</strong> Ethan DeGuzman, Mickie Enad, Safwan Kasim, Will Lavanakul
 </br>
For this project, my team and I were to develop a solution to solve an individual need or world problem. Our solution had to be innovated from an already existing product or a completely new product. The solution my team and I came up with was to help solve the problem of car heat strokes. Our solution involved a sensor system that would detect any life form trapped or left in the car. Then, an AC system will turn on and an alarm would be activated. This project went from May 8th to May 22nd in 2017. My tasks of this project was to brainstorm solutions, help construct the prototype of the vehicle and the integrated sensor system, help with the programming part of the solution, and help with the documentation, as well as the presentation. My brainstorm ideas helped the team because one of my ideas eventually was improved upon on to become our final solution. To help my team build the prototype, I constructed the the AC system of the vehicle using a fan. In addition, I built the base and top of the vehicle. To add on, I used a gear system that involved two small gears touching one side of each gear in a small cylinder to make the vehicle move. After I built the gear system, I placed the ultrasonic sensors along the sides of the car. The ultrasonic sensors were used to detect if a living thing was left in the car, and also used as a stopping mechanism. The skills I used to construct our vehicle can be later on pursued in the field of mechanical engineering.  Another task I had was to help develop the program for the device by reviewing the code and making sure it works the way my team and I want it to. I was able to fix parts of the code in order for our device to work. I completed this task with the help from my project manager. The programming skills I obtained from this project will help me pursue my area of interest, which is computer engineering. In addition, I was able to complete parts of the documentation and presentation so that the team and I could meet the deadline of the project. The skills I learned during this project were the basics of constructing automobiles, and learning how to program a closed loop system involving ultrasonic sensors. One challenge that I faced was working with the ultrasonic sensors. The ultrasonic sensors were unreliable because their values were very inconsistent. Overall, this project helped me learn how to develop a solution that companies will want to fund and manufacture.

<strong>Objective:</strong> Create a game or story that will be developed into a product using the program Scratch. 
</br>
<strong>Team Members:</strong> Ethan DeGuzman and Mickie Enad
 </br>
For this project, my team and I were to create a game or story that will eventually develop into a product using the program Scratch. My team and I decided to create a game. Requirements for the game are that the game should involve user interaction, have an objective with several difficulties, and as many degress of progress toward the objective. The game my team and I created is called the "Terrifying Maze." This game has multiple levels with multiple mazes. The user has to find an amount of items before time runs out or when the ghoul catches them. The game will get progressively harder, time will slowly decrease after each level, and the maze itself gets harder to maneuver around. My specific role in this project was to help my teamate, Ethan, program the game and help him with any problems that occur. My main role was documentation. I was to document everything we did day to day, keep a daily log, record our brianstorms, top ideas, and our final idea. In addition, I was to create a flowchart and directions for the game so that the directions and objective of the game is clear to the user. Things I learned during this project were how to work with a team, create a program with a team, and I learned the basic skills of the program Scratch. Some challenges that we had to overcome were that we did not know how to create a maze in the first place. But by doing some research and combing our programming knowledge, we came up with the idea to create a maze as a sprite, which actually worked. I was able to keep the team on task everyda, we were able to work diligently, and my partner made it easier on me by being a great teamate.

<strong>Objective:</strong> Choose our own app (Intermediate or Advanced) and sign up for it with our instructor. Create the app using tutorial and then improve it.  
</br>
<strong>Team Members:</strong> Vincent Nguyen and Mickie Enad
 </br>
For this project, my team and I were to choose an app, Intermediate or Advanced Level, and create the app using the tutorial given. Then, our goal is to make the app different from the tutorial and improve the quality or the app itself. The app that we choose and ended up with is the "Oh My Spikes" app. The "Oh My Spikes" app is an advanced tutorial and a 2-D game. The objective of the game is to last as long as you can to get the best score. The user has to lead the bird left or right without going through spikes, and if it hits a spike, it dies. You earn points by hitting the wall, but not the spike. The way my partner and I improved the game was we added other obstacles, a time constraint, and moving objects. We also added lives and power ups to help lower the difficulity of the game and help the user get a higher score. My specific role in the project was to make sure documentation is updated and to also help my partner with the programming and coding if he ran into problems that he needed help with. I was to document everything we did everyday, keep a daily log, record our brianstorms, top ideas, and our final idea. To help the user understand how our app works and how to play our game(app), I created instructions for the user. What I learned from this project is the fundamental skills of app inventor and gained a better knowledge of certain conditions and functions in app inventor. I also learned how to do pair programming, where two programmers are working on one program on one computer. Some challenges that we overcame was at some point in time when developing our application and adding new features, our application had some glitches. The game would never end because the bird would never die, therefore making the game continuous. This problem occured when we were trying to add a certain number of lives for the user. We were able to fix this problem by working together and asking our instructor for help. I was able to lead the team by making sure my partner knew what he had to do and when he needed to complete it. More importantly, I was able to work with him nicely because my partner was open to discussion and was not afraid to ask for help.
