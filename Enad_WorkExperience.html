<h2 style="text-align:left">Field Trips</h2> </br>
<p style="float:left; width:65%; margin:1rem; line-height: 2">
<strong>Workday</strong>
</br>
Throughout high school, I was fortunate enough to go on some of the many field trips offered by the Dublin High School Engineering program. One field trip that stood out was the Workday field trip during my Sophomore year. Being at Workday was my first insight (or look or introduction) into the real-life ‘work day’ of a company. I was able to learn about the tasks that engineers have to face every day. For example, a tip one of the engineers at workday gave me was about how to deal with the many meetings he or she as a project manager might face. But the most impactful part of this field trip for me was that I was able to not only network with some of the employees, which included recent graduates, but also learn how the employees got to where they are now. For instance, hearing that the recent college graduates went through Workday’s internship program during college and then came out of college with a job, inspired me to pursue such opportunities and make that an emphasis in college. 
</br>
<strong>Stanford and Computer Science History Museum</strong>
</br>
Another field trip that stood out to me was the Stanford and Computer Science History Museum field trip during my senior year. I actually have been to Stanford and toured their campus before this field trip, but because I was applying to Stanford, I wanted to get a better feel for the campus and its environment. This field trip did just that and more. It was a more memorable campus tour than my last one because one, it was more of an engineering-based tour, and two, because it was during ‘rivalry week’ for the big game against Cal. To be able to see how spirited Stanford students made me even more interested in applying to the campus. In addition to the campus tour of Stanford, we toured the Computer Science History Museum. Learning about the history of computers, some specific computer programs, and a little bit of artificial intelligence was fun and interesting, especially because some of the things at the museum, I was learning about in my AP CSA (Computer Science Application) class.

<h2 style="text-align:left">Guest Speakers</h2> </br>
<p style="float:left; width:65%; margin:1rem; line-height: 2">
<strong>Gary Richard</strong> 
</br>
Mr.Richard visited my IED (Introduction to Engineering) class during my Freshman year. He talked about working with nuclear weapons, and skills, like intelligence analysis or system analysis, that his job requires of him. However, the most interesting part of his presentation was the experiences in the field he had. For example, he told a story about a time where he actually lost a finger in the field because of a bomb or some type of nuclear weapon. His stories brought a more dangerous and ‘fun’ aspect to engineering. At the time, engineering was a new thing for me. Learning about how these engineering disciplines and skills that we were learning in class can be applied to tasks that involved such dangerous and exciting things like nuclear weapons, was one of the reasons why I wanted to keep pursuing engineering. Mr.Richard made engineering feel like a ‘superpower’ that could either change the world for the better or good.
</br>
<strong>Anthony W. Strawa</strong>
</br>
Mr.Strawa was a director and aeronautical engineer at NASA that visited my POE (Principle of Engineer) class during my Sophmore year. He talked about how NASA’s mission was to drive advances in science, technology, and use space exploration to enhance knowledge. To add on, he talked about some aerospace engineering concepts like the Drake equation and the meaning of the Goldilox zone. However, what stood out to me was his passion and emphasis that how important innovation is and how key it is to advancing science and society. From then on, I was inspired to take engineering a steep further and keep innovating so that I am able to, later on, make a postive impact on the world by innovating through engineering.

<h2 style="text-align:left">Mentorship Experience</h2> </br>
<p style="float:left; width:65%; margin:1rem; line-height: 2">
For the DEDA Mentorship program that the engineering acdemy offered, my mentor was Simon Harrison. Mr.Harrison is a senior director at Veeva. His guidance helped better develop my communication skills, expanded my viewpoints on my academic career and life, and helped me consider new ways of approaching certain situations that I might face throughout my academic career, as well as life. He was like a coach to me because he helped improve my skills and advance my career by guiding me in the right direction throughout the program and beyond. To add on, one specific skill that he helped me with was my interview skills. I learned from him how to better prepare for an interview, address and highlight my skills, use specific examples and personal experiences, and most importantly, keep contact with the interviewee. Besides all the technical stuff that I learned from him, he was just a great mentor and person to talk to. For example, when we had our first meeting, and we talked about the first computer terminal Mr.Harrison used in school; which was the ASR - 33. After the meeting, I did some searching to find out that that device was a printing terminal and a program storage device. I found this device to be the most ancient technology I have seen besides a typewriter. Once I told him that it was basically dinosaur age technolgoy to me, we had a good laugh about that. I admire Mr. Harrison, and I was fortunate enough to have him as my mentor.
